## The test of DiffDock-Pocket

I tried two types of commands:
1) with all the residues as flexible
2) with no flexible residue

Both of them ran about 20 hours on the cluster (8 GPUs), and for the fasudil and ligand47, most of the frames failed ( I'm trying to figure it out). For the ligand 23,
The success rate is over 90% but I haven't validated the credibility of these results.
